/*
ALGORITHM: Vowel and Consonant Counter using LEX

1. INITIALIZATION:
   - Declare vowel_count = 0 (to count vowels)
   - Declare const_count = 0 (to count consonants)
   - Include necessary header files

2. PATTERN MATCHING RULES:
   a. Vowel Pattern: [aeiouAEIOU]
      - When any vowel (uppercase or lowercase) is encountered
      - Increment vowel_count by 1
   
   b. Consonant Pattern: [a-zA-Z]
      - When any alphabetic character is encountered
      - Check if it's not a vowel (implicitly handled by rule order)
      - Increment const_count by 1
      
3. FILE PROCESSING:
   - Read input from standard input or file
   - Call yylex() to tokenize and process based on defined patterns
   - Each vowel/consonant match triggers corresponding counter increment

4. OUTPUT:
   - Display total number of vowels found
   - Display total number of consonants found

5. TERMINATE:
   - yywrap() returns 1 to indicate end of input
   - Program exits successfully
