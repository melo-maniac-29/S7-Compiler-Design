ALGORITHM: Character, Word, Line, and Space Counter using LEX

1. INITIALIZATION:
   - Declare counters: c=0 (characters), w=0 (words), line=1 (lines), space=0 (spaces)
   - Include necessary header files

2. PATTERN MATCHING RULES:
   a. Space Pattern: [" "]*
      - When one or more spaces are encountered
      - Increment space counter by 1
   
   b. Newline Pattern: ["\n"]*
      - When one or more newlines are encountered
      - Increment line counter by 1
   
   c. Word Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9]+
      - When alphanumeric sequence (word) is found
      - Increment word counter by 1
      - Add the length of the word (yyleng) to character counter

3. FILE PROCESSING:
   - Open "input.txt" for reading
   - Call yylex() to tokenize and process the file based on defined patterns
   - Each match triggers corresponding action (incrementing counters)

4. OUTPUT:
   - Display total characters counted
   - Display total words counted
   - Display total lines counted
   - Display total spaces counted

5. TERMINATE:
   - yywrap() returns 1 to indicate end of input
   - Program exits successfully
